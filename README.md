# RightOn Education

### Our Mission & Vision
<strong>Mission:</strong> Maybe you too know kids (or even adults) who'll say things like, "I'm not a math person." Our mission is to unlock every studentâ€™s potential in math, and we're doing so by creating apps that make it more engaging, foster a positive culture of error, and focus not only on proficiency, but also self-confidence.

<strong>Vision:</strong> In the future, we envision <a href="https://www.rightoneducation.com"><strong><i>RightOn!</i></strong></a> to become a multi-channel learning platform and game show (spanning mobile apps and livestream video), one that eventually helps connect students of all ages and backgrounds to learn new subjects -- from math today to others in the future. 

### Project Description
We're currently developing two apps:
1. A React Native mobile app for middle/high school teachers to use in classroom environments. Think Balderdash/Fibbage + math + learning from and having fun with mistakes and misconceptions. 
2. A React web app that enables teachers to create games/questions that appear in the mobile app.

We're running on AWS, including AppSync/GraphQL, DynamoDB, and Lambda. A future phase might include a math-focused version of MrBeast's <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/04/27/mrbeast-youtube-creator-games-nadeshot-ninja/"><strong>online rock-papers-scissors tournament</strong></a>, building upon the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-amplify-unicorntrivia-workshop"><strong>AWS Unicorn Trivia Workshop</strong></a> using Elemental Media Services.

#### Setting up and app

Click into the **web** or **mobile** directory to learn how to get started.

### Files needed / Additional notes

The `react-native` npm package.
<br>
A `local.properties` file if testing on Android.
<br>
The Xcode editor if testing on iOS.
<br>

#### Note:
Some NPM packages may be out of date and need to be updated for the Android build.
<br>
If you encounter the following error:
<br>
> A problem occurred evaluating project ':amazon-cognito-identity-js'.
> Could not find method implementation() for arguments [com.facebook.react:react-native:+]
<br>
Locate the `build.gradle` file in `node_modules/amazon-cognito-identity.js/android`, find the line mentioned in the `dependencies` object, and change `implementation` to `compile`.
<br>
<br>
If you receive a `hasteImpl returning the same name for different files` error in your packager. This is due to identical path names created by AWS Amplify. To fix this issue, simply drag the `#current-cloud-backend` folder from `${root}/amplify` out, restart the packager and run again.

### Contributing

We welcome contributions from all, and each contribution truly makes a difference. Please report issues directly to us or make pull requests for any features or bug fixes. Our app strives to create an environment where students (and teachers alike) feel more comfortable with and less intimidated by making mistakes in math class -- indeed, that's how we all take our learning to the next level. In a similar way, we always appreciate help and guidance with fixing our bugs -- that's how we take our own work to the next level!

Please refer to our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/righton-dev/righton-app/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Additional Documentation

Please refer to our [docs](https://github.com/righton-dev/righton-app/tree/master/docs)

### Communication channels

We are always happy to hear from people who are also interested in building learning apps and making math more fun and more achievable for all. We're building this plane as we fly it, and suggestions are always welcome and appreciated. Give us a shout anytime at info@rightoneducation.com.
