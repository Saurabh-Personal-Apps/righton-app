# RightOn Game Manager (Web)

RightOn's Game Manager web portal allows teachers and admins to create games for students.

The web app was bootstrapped with Create React App. It uses React 16.12, and a combination of JS and TypeScript.

Right now we are developing a prototype using AWS AppSync (a GraphQL helper on top of the database). We do not have tests set up yet -- **that would be a good intro task**. Here are some screenshots of the prototype forms:

### Getting Started

#### 1) Clone project

`git clone https://github.com/righton-dev/righton-app.git`
`cd web`

#### 2) Install node modules

`yarn install`

#### 3) Start your app (in development mode)

`yarn start`
